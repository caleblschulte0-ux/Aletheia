## Charters

- **Barkly** (`Money_Machine` @ `claude/barkley-mvp-mobile-qbegtj`, low risk): 0/8 steps; last human or builder commit 2026-09-23T14:39:43Z; next step 1 (thea): Get Barkly CI green on the project branch: its 'Production dependency audit' step fails on every push
- **Holdco platform** (`Money_Machine` @ `claude/ai-holdco-master-playbook-i5q80w`, low risk): 0/5 steps; last human or builder commit 2026-08-06T02:51:23Z; next step 1 (caleb): Pick the one offer to test first and write it as one sentence in docs/NEXT_OFFER.md on the holdco branch (or tell any Claude session to)
- **Instagram Auto Post Setup** (`Aletheia` @ `live`, high risk): 0/4 steps; last human or builder commit 2026-10-09T17:16:11Z; next step 1 (caleb): Switch the Instagram account to a professional account. This is first, and everything else fails without it: the Meta app cannot see a personal account. In the Instagram app: your profile -> the three-line menu -> Settings and privacy -> Account type and tools -> Switch to professional account -> Business.
- **Open Range demo films** (`Money_Machine` @ `claude/open-range-promo-video-4n7k7o`, low risk): 0/4 steps; last human or builder commit 2026-09-23T12:07:14Z; next step 1 (thea): Write a one-page status of the five-film slate in handoff/STATUS.md: which films are delivered, where each master and contact sheet lives, and what is still open
- **Schwab trader** (`schwab-trader` @ `main`, high risk): 0/5 steps; last human or builder commit 2026-10-01T23:46:23Z; next step 1 (caleb): Answer the sell approval waiting since June 26 (schwab-trader issue #5): comment approve, hold, or close it
